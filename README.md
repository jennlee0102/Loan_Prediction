### Abstract
In the evolving landscape of the financial sector, loans play a pivotal role in contributing to a bankâ€™s income, accompanied by substantial financial risks. The demand for loans is on the rise globally, as highlighted in the 2023 TransUnion report. With the surge in online banking post-2019 pandemic, predicting loan approval has become crucial. This paper delves into the application of various machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and neural network, to enhance loan approval predictions. Through a comprehensive literature review, we draw on studies to underscore the efficacy of machine learning approaches. The main objective of this paper is to find the model with the best performance on predicting whether the loan to particular person will be assigned or not. This paper is mainly divided into three sections: (1) introduction about our project, including the background, literature review and the theoretical knowledge of the models we need to discuss. (2) data processing, describing the data, clean the data, rearrange and spilt into new reasonable data set. (3) Comparison of machine learning models on collected data by some statistical metrics of the result of the prediction of each model.
